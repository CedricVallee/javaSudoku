# javaSudoku
This repository contains code to implement a sudoky grid generator. Grids are generated using a Dancing Links method, and have a unique solution. Each grid is minimal, which means that they have the minimum number of pre-filled cells.
Tests and grids are included to measure the performance of a Backtracking sudoku solver, of a Dancing Links sudoku solver, and of the sudoku grid generator itself.
